# CS-Project-2024B

This is my final project in C language for academic course "Systems Programming Lab" in The Open University.
The program is an Assembler, Assembly language translator, that proccesses files of a custom-defined Assembly language.
The programs recieves input files and outputs code errors, warnings, and an .ob file.
The .ob file contains code in machine language (i.e. ones and zeros) that represents the commands in the original assembly file.
