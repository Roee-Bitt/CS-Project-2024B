# CS-Project-2024B

This is my project in C language in course "Ma'abada Betichnoot Ma'arachot".
It is an Assembler that proccess assembly language file.
It returns errors, warnings, and finally gives a .ob file.
That file contains Machine langugae (i.e. 01010100011) that represents the commands in the original assembly file.
